## Introduction

Laravel provides a powerful filesystem abstraction thanks to the wonderful [Flysystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) PHP package by Frank de Jonge. The Laravel Flysystem integration provides simple to use drivers for working with local filesystems, Amazon S3, and Rackspace Cloud Storage. Even better, it's amazingly simple to switch between these storage options as the API remains the same for each system.

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

The filesystem configuration file is located at `config/filesystems.php`. Within this file you may configure all of your "disks". Each disk represents a particular storage driver and storage location. Example configurations for each supported driver is included in the configuration file. So, simply modify the configuration to reflect your storage preferences and credentials.

Of course, you may configure as many disks as you like, and may even have multiple disks that use the same driver.

<a name="the-public-disk"></a>
#### The Public Disk

The `public` disk is meant for files that are going to be publicly accessible. By default, the `public` disk uses the `local` driver and stores these files in `storage/app/public`. To make them accessible from the web, you should create a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`. This convention will keep your publicly accessible files in one directory that can be easily shared across deployments when using zero down-time deployment systems like [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io).

Of course, once a file has been stored and the symbolic link has been created, you can create an URL to the files using the `asset` helper:

    echo asset('storage/file.txt');

#### The Local Driver

When using the `local` driver, note that all file operations are relative to the `root` directory defined in your configuration file. By default, this value is set to the `storage/app` directory. Therefore, the following method would store a file in `storage/app/file.txt`:

    Storage::disk('local')->put('file.txt', 'Contents');

#### Other Driver Prerequisites

Before using the S3 or Rackspace drivers, you will need to install the appropriate package via Composer:

- Amazon S3: `league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 ~1.0`
- Rackspace: `league/flysystem-rackspace ~1.0`

#### FTP Driver Configuration

Laravel's Flysystem integrations works great with FTP; however, a sample configuration is not included with the framework's default `filesystems.php` configuration file. If you need to configure a FTP filesystem, you may use the example configuration below:

    'ftp' => [
        'driver'   => 'ftp',
        'host'     => 'ftp.example.com',
        'username' => 'your-username',
        'password' => 'your-password',

        // Optional FTP Settings...
        // 'port'     => 21,
        // 'root'     => '',
        // 'passive'  => true,
        // 'ssl'      => true,
        // 'timeout'  => 30,
    ],

#### Rackspace Driver Configuration

Laravel's Flysystem integrations works great with Rackspace; however, a sample configuration is not included with the framework's default `filesystems.php` configuration file. If you need to configure a Rackspace filesystem, you may use the example configuration below:

    'rackspace' => [
        'driver'    => 'rackspace',
        'username'  => 'your-username',
        'key'       => 'your-key',
        'container' => 'your-container',
        'endpoint'  => 'https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/',
        'region'    => 'IAD',
        'url_type'  => 'publicURL',
    ],

## Basic Usage

<a name="obtaining-disk-instances"></a>
### Obtaining Disk Instances

The `Storage` facade may be used to interact with any of your configured disks. For example, you may use the `put` method on the facade to store an avatar on the default disk. If you call methods on the `Storage` facade without first calling the `disk` method, the method call will automatically be passed to the default disk:

    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Storage;
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

    class UserController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * Update the avatar for the given user.
         *
         * @param  Request  $request
         * @param  int  $id
         * @return Response
         */
        public function updateAvatar(Request $request, $id)
        {
            $user = User::findOrFail($id);

            Storage::put(
                'avatars/'.$user->id,
                file_get_contents($request->file('avatar')->getRealPath())
            );
        }
    }

When using multiple disks, you may access a particular disk using the `disk` method on the `Storage` facade. Of course, you may continue to chain methods to execute methods on the disk:

    $disk = Storage::disk('s3');

    $contents = Storage::disk('local')->get('file.jpg');

<a name="retrieving-files"></a>
### Retrieving Files

The `get` method may be used to retrieve the contents of a given file. The raw string contents of the file will be returned by the method:

    $contents = Storage::get('file.jpg');

The `exists` method may be used to determine if a given file exists on the disk:

    $exists = Storage::disk('s3')->exists('file.jpg');

### File URLs

When using the `local` or `s3` drivers, you may use the `url` method to get the URL for the given file. If you are using the `local` driver, this will typically just prepend `/storage` to the given path and return a relative URL to the file. If you are using the `s3` driver, the fully qualified remote URL will be returned.

    $url = Storage::url('file1.jpg');

> **Note:** When using the `local` driver, be sure to [create a symbolic link at `public/storage`](#the-public-disk) which points to the `storage/app/public` directory.

#### File Meta Information

The `size` method may be used to get the size of the file in bytes:

    $size = Storage::size('file1.jpg');

The `lastModified` method returns the UNIX timestamp of the last time the file was modified:

    $time = Storage::lastModified('file1.jpg');

<a name="storing-files"></a>
### Storing Files

The `put` method may be used to store a file on disk. You may also pass a PHP `resource` to the `put` method, which will use Flysystem's underlying stream support. Using streams is greatly recommended when dealing with large files:

    Storage::put('file.jpg', $contents);

    Storage::put('file.jpg', $resource);

The `copy` method may be used to copy an existing file to a new location on the disk:

    Storage::copy('old/file1.jpg', 'new/file1.jpg');

The `move` method may be used to rename or move an existing file to a new location:

    Storage::move('old/file1.jpg', 'new/file1.jpg');

#### Prepending / Appending To Files

The `prepend` and `append` methods allow you to easily insert content at the beginning or end of a file:

    Storage::prepend('file.log', 'Prepended Text');

    Storage::append('file.log', 'Appended Text');

<a name="file-visibility"></a>
### File Visibility

File visibility can be retrieved and set via the `getVisibility` and `setVisibility` methods. Visibility is the abstraction of file permissions across multiple platforms:

    Storage::getVisibility('file.jpg');

    Storage::setVisibility('file.jpg', 'public');

Additionally, you can set the visibility when setting the file via the `put` method. The valid visibility values are `public` and `private`:

    Storage::put('file.jpg', $contents, 'public');

<a name="deleting-files"></a>
### Deleting Files

The `delete` method accepts a single filename or an array of files to remove from the disk:

    Storage::delete('file.jpg');

    Storage::delete(['file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']);

<a name="directories"></a>
### Directories

#### Get All Files Within A Directory

The `files` method returns an array of all of the files in a given directory. If you would like to retrieve a list of all files within a given directory including all sub-directories, you may use the `allFiles` method:

    $files = Storage::files($directory);

    $files = Storage::allFiles($directory);

#### Get All Directories Within A Directory

The `directories` method returns an array of all the directories within a given directory. Additionally, you may use the `allDirectories` method to get a list of all directories within a given directory and all of its sub-directories:

    $directories = Storage::directories($directory);

    // Recursive...
    $directories = Storage::allDirectories($directory);

#### Create A Directory

The `makeDirectory` method will create the given directory, including any needed sub-directories:

    Storage::makeDirectory($directory);

#### Delete A Directory

Finally, the `deleteDirectory` may be used to remove a directory, including all of its files, from the disk:

    Storage::deleteDirectory($directory);

## Custom Filesystems

Laravel's Flysystem integration provides drivers for several "drivers" out of the box; however, Flysystem is not limited to these and has adapters for many other storage systems. You can create a custom driver if you want to use one of these additional adapters in your Laravel application.

In order to set up the custom filesystem you will need to create a [service provider](/docs/{{language}}/{{version}}/providers) such as `DropboxServiceProvider`. In the provider's `boot` method, you may use the `Storage` facade's `extend` method to define the custom driver:

    <?php

    namespace App\Providers;

    use Storage;
    use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
    use Dropbox\Client as DropboxClient;
    use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
    use League\Flysystem\Dropbox\DropboxAdapter;

    class DropboxServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    {
        /**
         * Perform post-registration booting of services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function boot()
        {
            Storage::extend('dropbox', function($app, $config) {
                $client = new DropboxClient(
                    $config['accessToken'], $config['clientIdentifier']
                );

                return new Filesystem(new DropboxAdapter($client));
            });
        }

        /**
         * Register bindings in the container.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function register()
        {
            //
        }
    }

The first argument of the `extend` method is the name of the driver and the second is a Closure that receives the `$app` and `$config` variables. The resolver Closure must return an instance of `League\Flysystem\Filesystem`. The `$config` variable contains the values defined in `config/filesystems.php` for the specified disk.

Once you have created the service provider to register the extension, you may use the `dropbox` driver in your `config/filesystem.php` configuration file.
